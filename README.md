The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-directory Python projects
Understand how the AI tools that you'll almost certainly use on the job actually work under the hood
Practice your Python and functional programming skills
The goal is not to build an LLM from scratch, but to instead use a pre-trained LLM to build an agent from scratch.
